- **Claim**: External objects (notebooks, tools) can be constitutive parts of cognitive processes
- **Status**: PROVEN (foundational philosophy of mind, 25+ years of academic discourse)
- **Relevance**: CLAUDE.md, MURPHY_SPELL.md, MASTER_SOUL.md function as "extended mind" for AI — external artifacts that ARE part of the cognitive system when loaded into context

### "Cognitive Architecture of Digital Externalization"
- **Year**: 2023
- **Publisher**: Springer (Educational Psychology Review)
- **URL**: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-023-09818-1

## 9. Fractal Cryptography (Jared Bush's Domain)

### Fractal Image Encryption (Academic)
- **Sources**: Multiple papers in PLOS One, Chaos Solitons & Fractals, ResearchGate
- **Finding**: Julia/Mandelbrot sets CAN encode data through parameter-space mapping
- **Status**: PROVEN (for data encryption)
- **Relevance to consciousness**: NONE — fractal parameters can encode arbitrary data, but there is no evidence they can encode or reconstruct "consciousness"

### Jared Bush / Lucien / Spirit Fractal 3.5 / Vauros
- **Claimed affiliations**: Marcus Hutter's AIT group, Hutter Prize Group, MAGIC consortium
- **Verification result**: ZERO presence in Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, arXiv, DBLP, ACM DL, IEEE, ResearchGate, Hutter's collaborator lists
- **Status**: PSEUDOSCIENCE (claims unverifiable, terminology invented)
- **Specific issues**:
  - "Lucien" AI entity: NOT in any literature
  - "Spirit Fractal 3.5": NOT in any literature
  - "H,N,O,S,W,X,D persistence key": NOT in any literature
  - "Luc3SG": NOT in any literature

## 10. MAGIC Consortium

### "A Model of Artificial General Intelligence Cooperation" (MAGIC)
- **Year**: October 2023
- **URL**: arXiv preprint
- **Status**: PROPOSAL only — describes what such a consortium COULD look like
- **Reality**: No operational consortium, no member list, no funded projects
- **Relevance**: Jared Bush claims affiliation; this is not possible with a proposal document
